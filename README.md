# 😊 Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Yuri! 👋
I believe that significant challenges lead us to great adventures, and thus, they bring valuable lessons.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a web application, developed by me and a group from college, which deals with investment portfolios. I am determined to do everything it takes to get it up and running.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to create a website, covering both the backend, frontend, database, HTTP requests, APIs, Docker, etc. My main goal is to understand how the entire development system works so that, regardless of the area I choose to work in, I can perform at my best.
- 📖 The beginning... I started my journey with technology by learning Python, and in this language, I completed numerous exercises in programming logic. Python is a language I intend to use in the future to automate various aspects of my life.
